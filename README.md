Have you been traumatised by having your name misspelled while moving from one country to another? If the answer to some of these questions is _yes_, then this script might be for you.

This script find all the given name that are spelled identically in a configurable number of languages. For example, if your name is _Cristian_ expect your name to be misspelled to _Christian_ while living in France or German, _Krysztian_ while living in Poland and _Kristian_ while living in Sweden. On the other hand, if your name was _Ahmed_, it would be spelled correctly in numerous countries whose official language uses the Latin script.
