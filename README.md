Are you a Romanian-Hungarian that is expecting a baby with a Polish-Ukrainian? Are you living in Sweden, but consider moving to Germany or France? Have you been traumatised by having your name misspelled while moving from one country to another? If the answer to some of these questions is _yes_, then this script might be for you.

This script find all the given name that are spelled identically in a configurable number of languages. For example, if your name is _Cristian_ expect your name to be misspelled to _Christian_ while living in France or German, _Krystian_ while living in Poland and _Kristian_ while living in Sweden. On the other hand, if your name was _Ahmed_, it would be spelled correctly in numerous countries whose official language uses the Latin script.
